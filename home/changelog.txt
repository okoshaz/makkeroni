[[;#fff;]12. dec 2016.]
1st presentation as a santa claus gift for Péter Mozsdényi at http://mumia.art.pte.hu/mami/kbalazs/mozsios/ 

[[;#fff;]19. feb 2017. - 19. mai 2018.]
working version as AudiOS

[[;#fff;]19. mai 2018.]
changed the name to Makkeroni, and further developments:
added fmfreq
added fadeplay
added * to randomize parameters
added various improvements (unique username)
added cat to present textfiles: about.txt, reference.txt, changelog.txt :)

[[;#fff;]21. mai 2018.]
added sounds to the normal unix commands (ls, help etc.)
added 'wall' command in order to chat with others via the title of the page and the javascript console

[[;#fff;]22. mai 2018.]
published everything as http://makker.hu/makkeroni/ !

[[;#fff;]24. nov 2018.]
+updated to jquery terminal v2.0.1. some things doesn't work. 
+added watch - the command for repeatedly running other commands like play, freq or fmfreq.
+added ps command - it presents the running processes and their IDs! thanks for recommending it, unknown ICLC p2p Reviewer!:)
+fontsize works again! life is good...

[[;#fff;]25. nov 2018.]
+ refined pid display - instead of scrolling them, there are some lines above going to display the current values.
+ "click here to stop" messages on watch-ed processes and loopplay's are changed to blinkin' stars... why not. You can click them to remove the process, anyway stop, sleep and resume commands still also work! 
+ sleep, resume work with regions (for ex 1-5) and "all" parameters too

[[;#fff;]27. nov 2018.]
+ the first pipe! hip-hop hurray!
ps > something.txt saves the list of processes to a textfile, and...
cat something.txt > ps reads them back! whoaa... 
+ updated random parameters on freq values of freq and fmfreq commands: if You type *1000, it sets a range 0-9999; if *1000+500, generates random numbers between 500-1500 Hz. I'll add this feature to relevant arguments on other commands too.

[[;#fff;]8. dec 2018.]
+ added batch command: it can start any command in the same time in multiple instances. Can be good for example as a batch -n 8 freq to easily play a 8-tone sine pattern. 

[[;#fff;]9. dec 2018.]
+ added some weird digital effects. Please don't use them with headphones or in sensitive environment! They're extremely loud. 
The commands are blackdeath, degrade and bitshift. You can run only one in a time, and it can be removed with the 'deffect' command.
Only 'deffect' is autocompleted because of security risks.
Be aware please...

[[;#fff;]10. jan 2019.]
+ added separate connect and disconnect commands to open up or close the network connection for wall commands;
+ modified wall command to let sending commands to remote computers! just simply use "wall -c somecommand". please use the "connect" command before.

[[;#fff;]11. jan 2019.]
+ added makkeróni command for generating complex, fm/digital synthesized waves. has a lots and lots of arguments... (but works without any arguments or with asterisks as well!)
+ added on-line help (with the "--help" option) to the commands... So just type "makkeróni --help" and enjoy:)
+ autocomplete is now situation-dependent, which means that if You type play or cat, tab brings back the filenames to load.. (thanks, Jakub Jankiewitz to point out how to manage it!)

[[;#fff;]13. jan 2019.]
+ added seq for storing number of sequences in one of the 4 slots, and...
+ added stepseq (after a long time of debugging) for playing those sequences! see their --help or the reference for examples.
+ added seqlist for displaying stored sequences.
+ added tone for generating different waveforms than sine, fm and makkeróni... good for long lasting pads, maybe together with batch.

[[;#fff;]15. jan 2019.]
+ wall updated to be possible to set the region of users who can process the commands sent. with -min and -max options

[[;#fff;]17. jan 2019.]
+ stepseq now works with 'drum' as target: it plays
* Makkeróni was presented firstly for the public on the ICLC 2019 in Madrid. Thanks for attending!
